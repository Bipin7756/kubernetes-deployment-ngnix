Step to do deployment of ngnix in kubernetes

kubectl get nodes
# to check the status of the cluster

kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx
# command to create a deployment of NGINX using the NGINX image

kubectl get deployments
# to check the state of your deployment

kubectl describe deployment nginx
#to see more detail about your deployment

kubectl create service nodeport nginx --tcp=80:80
# we want to use the NodePort Service-type because we have both a public and private IP address and we do not need an external load balancer for now. With this service-type, Kubernetes will assign this service on ports on the 30000+ range

kubectl get svc
#Run the get svc command to see a summary of the service and the ports exposed

curl nodename:nodeport like 30386
